<!--SIMPLE HTML STRUCTURE-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- specifically used to declare that the document is written in HTML5, 
which is the latest major revision of HTML. -->

<html lang="en">
<!-- lang="en": This is an attribute within the <html> element that specifies the 
language of the document. In this case, "en" stands for English. -->

<head>
<!-- It is not visible to users and typically contains metadata and other elements 
that provide information about the web page rather than the content that is directly 
displayed to the user. -->

<meta charset="utf-8">
<!-- The charset attribute within the <meta> element is used to specify the character encoding
for the document. "UTF-8" stands for "Unicode Transformation Format - 8-bit" and is a character 
encoding standard that is widely used to represent text on the web. -->

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
<!-- <meta>: This is an HTML element used for including metadata about the web page.
name="viewport": The name attribute specifies the purpose or name of the particular 
metadata being provided. In this case, it's related to the viewport configuration. -->

<!-- width=device-width: This part sets the width of the viewport to be equal to the device's width. 
This is crucial for responsive web design, as it ensures that the web page's content adapts to 
the screen size of the device, making it mobile-friendly. -->

<!-- initial-scale=1: This part sets the initial zoom level when the web page is loaded. 
A value of 1 means there is no initial zoom applied, and the page is displayed at its natural, 
100% zoom level. This is important for ensuring that the web page doesn't appear zoomed in or 
out when first loaded on a mobile device. -->

<title>Page Title</title>
<!-- The text specified within the <title> element appears as the title of the web page in the 
browser's tab or window. It helps users identify the page when they have multiple tabs open and also 
when bookmarking or saving the page. -->
</head>

<body>
<!-- The <body> element in HTML represents the main content area of a web page. It contains all 
the visible content that is displayed to the user when they visit the page. -->

    <h1>My First Heading</h1>
    <p>My first paragraph.</p>

</body>
